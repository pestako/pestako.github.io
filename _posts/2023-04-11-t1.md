According to the latest survey by JobKorea, a job search engine in Korea, Java was the most in-demand programming language by companies, with a proportion of 41.7% in 2022. This is due to its stability, cross-platform compatibility, and wide range of applications.

Python is also growing rapidly in Korea, with a proportion of 28.9% in 2022, according to JobKorea's survey. It is widely used in fields such as data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Its popularity is also due to its simple syntax and easy-to-learn nature, making it a favorite among beginners.

C and C++ are still relevant in Korea, particularly in the gaming and embedded systems industries. According to JobKorea's survey, C/C++ had a proportion of 15.8% in 2022. These languages are preferred for their efficiency and low-level control.

In conclusion, the computer language market in Korea is diverse and ever-evolving. Companies in Korea have a high demand for various programming languages, and the proportion of each language used depends on the company's needs and the industry they are in. However, Java and Python are the two most in-demand languages, with C/C++ and other languages still relevant in specific industries.
