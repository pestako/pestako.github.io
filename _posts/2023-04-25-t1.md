South Korea has a large language teaching market, with a particular focus on English. In recent years, the demand for other languages such as Japanese, Chinese, French, and Spanish has also increased, although not to the same extent as English.

According to the Ministry of Education, as of 2021, there were 26,143 registered language institutes in South Korea. Out of these, around 90% were private institutes. These institutes offer a wide range of language courses to students of all ages, from young children to adults.

English is by far the most popular language taught in South Korea, and the demand for English education remains high. According to a 2019 report by the British Council, there were around 17,000 English language institutes in South Korea, with a market size of around $17.3 billion. The report also noted that South Korea is the largest market for English language education in Asia.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in learning other languages such as Japanese, Chinese, French, and Spanish. The Korean government has been actively promoting the learning of these languages as part of its efforts to increase internationalization and globalization.

According to a 2019 report by the Korea International Trade Association, the market size for Japanese language education in South Korea was around $738 million, while the market size for Chinese language education was around $582 million. The market size for French and Spanish language education was smaller, at around $39 million and $19 million respectively.

Overall, the language teaching market in South Korea is highly competitive, with many private institutes vying for students. The quality of language education can vary widely, and students and parents often spend considerable time and money researching and selecting the best institute for their needs.
