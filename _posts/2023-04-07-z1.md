Korean dialects refer to the different regional varieties of the Korean language spoken throughout the Korean Peninsula. There are several dialects, each with its own distinct pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. The most prominent dialects are the Seoul dialect, which is the standard dialect used in South Korea, and the Gyeongsang dialect, which is spoken in the southeastern region of the country.

The Seoul dialect, also known as the Gyeonggi dialect, is considered the standard dialect in South Korea. It is characterized by its flat intonation and softer pronunciation of consonants. The grammar of the Seoul dialect is also simpler compared to other dialects, making it easier to learn for foreigners. The Seoul dialect is spoken by approximately 10 million people, including the residents of the capital city, Seoul.

On the other hand, the Gyeongsang dialect, spoken in the southeastern region of the country, is known for its strong intonation and harsh pronunciation of consonants. It is often considered the most distinct dialect due to its unique vocabulary and grammar. The Gyeongsang dialect is spoken by approximately 10 million people, including the residents of Busan and Daegu, two of the largest cities in South Korea.
