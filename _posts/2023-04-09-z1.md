Mean:
The mean is the average of a set of numbers. In Python, you can use NumPy's mean function to find the mean of an array or a list.

~~~python

import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
mean = np.mean(data)

print(mean) # Output: 6.0

~~~

Median:
The median is the middle value in a set of numbers. In Python, you can use NumPy's median function to find the median of an array or a list.

~~~python

import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
median = np.median(data)

print(median) # Output: 6.0

~~~

Standard deviation:
The standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a set of numbers. In Python, you can use NumPy's std function to find the standard deviation of an array or a list.

~~~python

import numpy as np

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
std_dev = np.std(data)

print(std_dev) # Output: 2.8284271247461903
