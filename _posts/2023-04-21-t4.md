These centers typically offer services such as resume review, job search assistance, and networking opportunities with Korean companies. Some universities also host job fairs and recruitment events for students to meet with potential employers.

Overall, South Korea offers a wide range of student exchange programs and international programs for foreign students, as well as resources to help them find employment opportunities in Korea.
